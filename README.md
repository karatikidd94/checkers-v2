4. Getting Started: https://karatikidd94.github.io/checkers-v2/ 
  
  For my checkers game, Red will always make the first move. 
  
  Step 1: Click a Red Checker, if that checker has any available moves then the checker clicked will change to a green border along with any squares that             have available moves. 
  NOTE: You can change which checker you want to move by clicking a different checker, step 1 will repeat!
  Step 2: Click one of the green border squares to move your checker.
  Step 3: Turn automatically changes, repeat step 1 & 2 for the black checkers.

5. Next Steps: For future enhancements i plan to create a isKing function to allow a checker once reaching their opponents side to move backwards. Add a condition that will check if a player is blocked from moving forcing the opponent into an automatic win. Lastly id like to add another condition that will check for additional jump moves after the initial jump.
